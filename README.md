It looks like you've provided a comprehensive plan for mastering programming concepts and problem-solving. This roadmap covers a wide range of topics and gradually builds your skills. Here's your plan organized with links to relevant resources:

**Day −∞ to 0:** Get comfortable with programming languages like C and C++, focusing on pointers and objects.

**Day 1:** Understand Algorithmic complexity, both time and space. You can refer to resources like [Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/).

**Day 2 - 10:** Learn simple data structures:
- [Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-data-structure/) - Basic operations and complexity.
- [Linked Lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/) - Operations and complexity.
- [Strings](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-data-structure/) - Manipulation and complexity.
- [Stacks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/) - Implementations and complexity.
- [Queues](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/) - Types and complexity.


**Day 11 - 25:** Learn simple algorithms:
- Sorting: [Insertion sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/), [Merge sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/), [Quick sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/), [Heap sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-sort/).
- Searching: [Linear search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linear-search/), [Binary Search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/) (with variants).
- Prime Numbers: [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/), [Primality test](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/primality-test-set-1-introduction-and-school-method/).
- Strings: String searching, [Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-common-subsequence-dp-4/), Palindrome detection.
- Miscellaneous: [Euclidean algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/euclidean-algorithms-basic-and-extended/), [Matrix multiplication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-multiply-two-matrices/), [Fibonacci Numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-nth-fibonacci-number/), [Pascal's Triangle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pascal-triangle/), [Max Subarray problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/).

**Day 26 - 50:** Progress to more advanced topics:
- Work through coding interview resources like [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/), [Elements of Programming Interviews](https://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/), and [Programming Interviews Exposed](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Programming+Interviews+Exposed%2C+4th+Edition-p-9781119711563).
- Solve problems on platforms like [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/), focusing on arrays, linked lists, strings, stacks, queues, and complexity.

**Day 51 - 60:** Dive into non-linear data structures:
- Trees: [Binary Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/), [Binary Search Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/), Tree traversals, [Lowest Common Ancestor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/), Depth, Height & Diameter, [k-th smallest element](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst-order-statistics-in-bst/).
- [Heaps](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-data-structure/).
- [Hash table](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-set-1-introduction/): Solve problems like the [4 sum problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-four-elements-that-sum-to-a-given-value-set-2/), [Sudoku solution validity](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-given-sudoku-board-has-a-solution-or-not/).
- [Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-and-its-representations/): Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Topological sorting, Minimum spanning tree, Shortest path problems.

**Day 61 - 90:** Continue solving problems from trees, hash tables, heaps, and graphs using the resources mentioned earlier.

**Day 91 - 100:** Dive into advanced topics:
- Understand Computational Complexity theory and [NP-completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness).
- Study problems like the [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem), [Travelling Salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), and [SAT problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem).

**Day 101 - ∞:** You're now well-prepared! Keep revising the topics and start competitive programming. Good luck on your programming journey!

Remember, consistent practice and applying what you learn in actual coding problems will greatly enhance your skills.
